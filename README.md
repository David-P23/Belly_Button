# Belly_Button

## Overview
In this project I set out to visualize belly button bacterial data in several ways.  
These were to compare and contrast the biodiversity and a few other factors.  
I used javascript and HTML to create an interactive dashboard displaying a bar graph,  
meter, and bubble grid to accomplish the above. There is an interactive component  
in which a patient can be selected from a drop down menu.

## Results
After I had completed this analysis and compiled the visual components I selected  
a randon subject, 941, and displayed her results:

The interactive dashboard's visuals all updated and displayed the correct info.
